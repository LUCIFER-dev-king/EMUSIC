# E MUSIC

E MUSIC is a music player built with React (Typescript) and Firebase.

## Project Overview

E MUSIC is a music player built with React and Firebase. This E MUSIC fetches a list of songs and shows it to the user. The user is able to listen to the songs, if he/she likes it they add it to their library if he/she is signed in. E MUSIC has a custom music player component that plays songs. Also, users can search songs.
> It's a bit hard to find a songs API so I added a list of 10 songs to Firebase storage and store the reference in Firestore for CRUD operations.

- Play, Pause, Next, Previous, Fast Forward, Rewind a song.
